# CS541P8
Final Project
Basically I would like to build a small game on Android which extracted the concept from catching the prison-breaked prisoner.

There is basically n * n grid cells which indicate the places where the prisoner can escape. I will try to make prisoner go to the closer boundary to make him easier to escape, thus hard for players to catch him.

Make full use of the WALLS randomly generated!
